## Providing Feedback on Default Translations

Don't like our default translations? We'd love your help! Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Start by creating a PR with your suggested translation changes. While we typically don't merge PRs directly in this public repo, this gives us an easy way to see and track your proposed changes!

2. **Explain the Changes:** In the PR description or comments, provide a clear explanation of your proposed changes. Understanding the context helps us a lot!

3. **Feedback Consideration:** While we may not merge PRs here, please know that your feedback is incredibly important. If we like your changes, we'll make sure they find their way into our private repository.

4. **Updating Platform-Translations:** Changes made in our private repository are automaticly synchronized with this repository. This ensures that improvements made based on your feedback become part of the official translations for all users!

Your insights and language skills make a big difference in making our translations accurate. Thanks for being part of our collaborative effort to make Flatfile better for all users!
